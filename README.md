# Image & PDF to XLSX Conversion Pipeline

## Introduction
This project provides a simple pipeline for converting image and PDF-based company data into structured XLSX tables. It leverages `SuryaOCR` and `TesseractOCR` for extracting text from scanned documents, ensuring efficient and accurate data transformation.

## Motivation
Manual data entry from scanned documents is time-consuming and error-prone. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful OCR-based solutions, they can be resource-intensive and less accessible. Instead, this project explores lightweight and open-source alternatives like `SuryaOCR` and `TesseractOCR` to extract tabular data efficiently.

## Features
- Converts images and PDFs into structured Excel tables.
- Utilizes `SuryaOCR` and `TesseractOCR` for text extraction.
- Provides a simple and efficient workflow for document processing.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance table structure recognition for complex layouts.
- Optimize preprocessing steps for better OCR accuracy.
- Explore additional OCR engines for improved results.
